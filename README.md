## Motif-based Approximate Counting via Hypergraphs (MACH)

This is the modular code for approximate satisfiability counting for First Order defininite clauses following the original paper - *Das et al., AAAI 2019* [1]. This code implements the algorithm **M**otif-based **A**pproximate **C**ounting via **H**ypergraphs (MACH)
as a plug & play module. It can either be used independently as an approximate counting library for definite clauses of your choice *OR* it can be integrated with your favourite Probabilistic Logic Learner or Lifted Inference code (preferably java code), to make them scalable.
