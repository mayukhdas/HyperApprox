## Motif-based Approximate Counting via Hypergraphs (MACH)

This is the modular code for approximate satisfiability counting for First Order defininite clauses following the original paper - *Das et al., AAAI 2019* [1]. This code implements the algorithm <u>**M**</u>otif-based _**A**_pproximate _**C**_ounting via _**H**_ypergraphs (MACH)
as a plug & play module.
